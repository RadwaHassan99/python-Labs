## Part1:
1- Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them in
reverse order with a space between them.<br>

2- Write a Python program that accepts an integer (n) and computes the value of
n+nn+nnn.
Sample value of n is 5
Expected Result : 615 <br>

3- Write a Python program to print the following here document.
Sample string :
a string that you "don't" have to escape
This
is a ....... multi-line
heredoc string --------> example <br>

4- Write a Python program to get the volume of a sphere with radius 6. <br>

5- Write a Python program that will accept the base and height of a triangle and compute
the area. <br>

6- Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.<br>

7- Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverse it.<br>

8- Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6. <br>
9-Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50 <br>
Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers : <br>
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 <br>

10- Write a Python program that accepts a string as input, and then calculates and prints the number of digits and letters in the string<br>


## Part2:

1- Given a list of numbers, create a function that returns a list where all similar adjacent
elements have been reduced to a single element, so [1,2,3.3] returns [1,2,3]
Note:
You may create a new list or modify the passed in list.<br>

2- Consider dividing a string into two halves
Case1:
The length is even, the front and back halves are the same length.
Case2:
The length is odd, we’ll say that the extra char goes in the front half.
E.g. ‘abced’, the front half is ‘abc’, the back half’de.
Given 2 strings, a and b, return a string of the form:
(a-front + b-front) + (a-back +b-back) <br>

3- Write a Python function that takes a sequence of numbers and determines
whether all the numbers are different from each other.
E.X. [1,5,7,9] -> True
[2,4,5,5,7,9] -> False <br>

4- Given unordered list, sort it using algorithm bubble sort
( read about bubble sort and try to implement it)<br>

5- Gusses game
● Your game generates a random number and gives only 10 tries for the user to
guess that number.
● Get a user input and compare it with the random number
● Display a hit message to the user in case the use number is smaller or bigger of
the random number
● If the user type number is out of range(100), display a message that is not allowed
and don’t count this as try.
● If user type a number that has been entered before, display a hint message and
don’t count this as try
● In case the user entered a correct number within the 10 tries, display a
congratulations message and let your application guess another random number
with the remain number of tries
● If the user finishes all his tries, display a message to ask him if he wants to play
again or not.<br>
